Created the basic app for changing the colour and created the apk using     flutter build apk --release
Created all the backlog/ features in https://github.com/speaksStick/may_be_too_basic

To generate the code for the intl package for lang localization:
Create l10n under lib folder, create the .arb files in json format, add the supported locales
to the MaterialWidget in the main.dart. Then create the appLocalizations.dart and other files 
by running "flutter gen-l10n" in cmd

To store the files locally, we are using the hive storage, import hive, hive_flutter in dependencies and hive_generator: 
  build_runner: in dev_dependencies. For the Model class which needs to be stored must have attribute as @HiveType(typeId: 0, 1 ..)
and all other fields as   @HiveField(0, 1 ,..). add part 'HabitsModel.g.dart'; after import statement. Then you need to create the Model.g.dart 
class, generator package helps to create the class. Use the below command in terminal : "flutter packages pub run build_runner build"
